## A **Scalable Chat App** built with modern technologies to handle high traffic and real-time messaging. 

- **Kafka** manages message queues for reliable, distributed communication.
- **Next.js** powers the frontend, providing a smooth, performant UI.
- **Redis** is used for caching active user sessions and quick data retrieval.
- **Socket.io** enables real-time, bidirectional communication between clients.
- **Postgres** serves as the main database, storing user data and chat history securely.
- **TypeScript** ensures type safety and better maintainability across the app's codebase.
In simple terms:

- **Prisma** is an **open-source database toolkit** that makes it easier to work with databases in applications. It helps developers define the structure of their database (schema) and simplifies common tasks like querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data.

- **Prisma Client** is an **auto-generated library** that Prisma creates based on your database schema. It’s essentially a set of functions you can use in your code to interact with your database easily, without writing raw SQL queries. Instead, you can work with JavaScript or TypeScript objects and methods, making database interactions faster and less error-prone.

In simple words:

**Supabase** is an open-source backend platform that provides all the essential tools for building applications without needing to set up and manage your own backend infrastructure. It’s often described as a simpler, open-source alternative to Firebase.

Here’s what it includes:
- **Database**: A managed PostgreSQL database that you can use to store and retrieve your app’s data.
- **Authentication**: Tools to handle user sign-up, login, and security.
- **APIs**: Automatic RESTful APIs are generated for your database, so you can interact with it right away.
- **Realtime**: Updates your app in real time when data changes.
- **Storage**: For handling and managing files like images and videos.

Supabase is developer-friendly, works with SQL, and is designed to get projects up and running quickly without complex backend setup.
